const AbstractStory="Hello, I am CagrÄ±! I have graduated from Air Force Academy in 2014, with Bachelor Degree on Aerospace Engineering. Then I attended Air Force - Air Traffic Management Program and have also graduated from there in 2015. I've been, chronologically, chief military ATC, ATM Commander, Head of Aerodrome and Flight Operations at the TuAF. In 2020 I realised my wish, on becoming an Airline Pilot and attended trainings of a private flight schools in 2021. I got Private Pilot License, then finished all the theoretical exams, flight checks and left the Air Force. However, due to pandemic effects on aviation industry, i decided to slow down and keep flying as a hobby, at the end of 2021. At the same time mentioned, my friends introduced me with software development. So, since Feb, 2022 i have totally turned my face to the software develepment. Even though i am a newbie, i am well-known with my fast-learning, rapid-adapting personality and leaving my confort-zone, without much hesitation. So.. Nice to meet you :) "
